**Instructions for running 'RMarkdown_introduction' exercise:**

'athlete_events.csv' data file is over 40MB and it was made avilable in the 'main' data folder. In order to Knit 'RMarkdown_Intro_Solution.Rmd' without getting an error message (Error: "... cannot open connection") you would need to copy the file  './data/athlete_events.csv' into './RMarkdown_Introduction/data' folder.
